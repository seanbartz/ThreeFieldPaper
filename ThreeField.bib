Quite generally, confinement and discrete spectra imply each other. Asymptotically linear glueball masses can also be achieved. Asymptotic mass ratios of various glueballs with different spin also turn out to be universal. Mesons dynamics is implemented via space filling D4-anti-D4 brane pairs. The associated tachyon dynamics is analyzed and chiral symmetry breaking is shown. The dynamics of the RR axion is analyzed, and the non-perturbative running of the QCD theta-angle is obtained.

abstract = {Various holographic approaches to QCD in five dimensions are explored using input both from the putative non-critical string theory as well as QCD. It is argued that a gravity theory in five dimensions coupled to a dilaton and an axion may capture the important qualitative features of pure QCD. A part of the higher alpha' corrections are resummed into a dilaton potential. The potential is shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the exact beta-function of QCD, and its knowledge determines the full structure of the vacuum solution. The geometry near the UV boundary is that of AdS\_5 with logarithmic corrections reflecting the asymptotic freedom of QCD. We find that all relevant confining backgrounds have an IR singularity of the "good" kind that allows unambiguous spectrum computations. Near the singularity the 't Hooft coupling is driven to infinity. Asymptotically linear glueball masses can also be achieved.

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5\backslash times \{\backslash bf S\}\^{}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \$\backslash N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.

abstract = {We numerically simulate planar shock wave collisions in anti-de Sitter space as a model for heavy ion collisions of large nuclei. We uncover a cross-over between two different dynamical regimes as a function of the collision energy. At low energies the shocks first stop and then explode in a manner approximately described by hydrodynamics, in close similarity with the Landau model. At high energies the receding fragments move outwards at the speed of light, with a region of negative energy density and negative longitudinal pressure trailing behind them. The rapidity distribution of the energy density at late times around mid-rapidity is not approximately boost-invariant but Gaussian, albeit with a width that increases with the collision energy.},

The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level \$n\$ acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as \$2\backslash left (n g\_\{YM\} \backslash sqrt \{2 N\} )\^{}\{1/2\}\$ for large `t Hooft coupling.

A modified bulk vacuum expectation value and a modified coefficient for the quartic term in the bulk scalar potential are introduced to obtain a smooth dilaton solution for computing the spectral functions of the vector and axial-vector mesons. It is demonstrated that the peaks appearing in the spectral functions characterize the thermal mass spectra of vector and axial-vector mesons, where the location of the peak moves to a lower value and the width of the peak becomes wider when increasing the temperature. We observe that the peak disappears completely at the critical temperature around \$T\_c=200\$ MeV, which implies the deconfinement of quark and the restoration of chiral symmetry breaking. A numerical study by fitting the spectral function in terms of the Breit-Wigner form has been made to show how the peak dissolves quantitatively when the temperature is increased to the critical point.},

abstract = {Recently a holographic model of hadrons motivated by AdS/CFT has been proposed to fit the low energy data of mesons. We point out that the infrared physics can be developed in a more systematic manner by exploiting backreaction of the nonperturbative condensates. We show that these condensates can naturally provide the IR cutoff corresponding to confinement, thus removing some of the ambiguities from the original formulation of the model. We also show how asymptotic freedom can be incorporated into the theory, and the substantial effect it has on the glueball spectrum and gluon condensate of the theory. A simple reinterpretation of the holographic scale results in a non-perturbative running for alpha\_s which remains finite for all energies. We also find the leading effects of adding the higher condensate into the theory. The difficulties for such models to reproduce the proper Regge physics lead us to speculate about extensions of our model incorporating tachyon condensation.},

It is pointed out that the model can accommodate both Regge spectra of hadrons and the linear potential between quarks. The model is formulated in the framework of graviton-dilaton-scalar system, where the dilaton field is dual to the dimension-2 gluon condensate and can lead to the linear confinement, while the scalar field corresponds to the quark anti-quark condensate and can explain the property of chiral dynamics.},

Holographic models encode information about chiral symmetry breaking, Weinberg sum rules, vector meson dominance, and other phenomenological features of QCD.

abstract = {In this work, we offer a dynamical soft-wall model to describe the gluodynamics and chiral dynamics in one systematical framework. We firstly construct a quenched dynamical holographic QCD (hQCD) model in the graviton-dilaton framework for the pure gluon system, then develop a dynamical hQCD model for the two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework by adding light flavors on the gluodynamical background. For two forms of dilaton background field \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\$ and \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\backslash tanh(\backslash mu\_\{G\^{}2\}\^{}4z\^{}2/\backslash mu\_G\^{}2)\$, the quadratic correction to dilaton background field at infrared encodes important non-perturbative gluodynamics and naturally induces a deformed warp factor of the metric. By self-consistently solving the deformed metric induced by the dilaton background field, we find that the scalar glueball spectra in the quenched dynamical model is in very well agreement with lattice data. For two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework, the deformed metric is self-consistently solved by considering both the chiral condensate and nonperturbative gluodynamics in the vacuum, which are responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement, respectively. It is found that the mixing between the chiral condensate and gluon condensate is important to produce the correct light flavor meson spectra. The pion form factor and the vector couplings are also investigated in the dynamical hQCD model. Besides, we give the criteria for the existence of linear quark potential from the metric structure, and show a negative quadratic dilaton background field is not favored in the graviton-dilaton framework.},

The Reissner-Nordstrom AdS black hole metric is introduced to describe both the finite temperature and density effects. The thermal spectral function is computed, which shows that the position of peak moves towards a smaller value and the width of peak also broadens to a larger value as the temperature increases. The critical temperature at which the peaks are completely dissolved has been found to be around \$T\_\{c\}\backslash simeq 160\backslash sim 200\backslash MeV\$. The effect of chemical potential is shown to be the same as the one caused by the temperature. It is found that when the temperature approaches to zero \$T\backslash approx 0\$, the melting down of mesons occurs at the scaled critical chemical potential \$\backslash mu\_0/\backslash kappa\backslash approx 2.2\backslash sim 2.4 \backslash GeV\$.},

abstract = {We discuss how a dominant tetraquark component of the lightest scalar mesons may emerge in AdS/QCD gravity duals. In particular, we show that the exceptionally strong binding required to render the tetraquark ground state lighter than the lowest-lying scalar quark-antiquark nonet can be holographically encoded into bulk-mass corrections for the tetraquark's dual mode. The latter are argued to originate from the anomalous dimension of the corresponding four-quark interpolator. To provide a concrete example, we implement this mechanism into the dilaton soft-wall dual for holographic QCD. Preventing the lowest-lying dual mode from collapsing into the AdS boundary then establishes a rather generic lower bound on the tetraquark mass (which may be overcome in the presence of additional background fields). We further demonstrate that the higher tetraquark excitations can become heavier than their quark-antiquark counterparts and are thus likely to dissolve into the multiparticle continuum.},

abstract = {Gauge/Gravity dualities open the non-perturbative realms of strongly-coupled gauge theories to analytic treatment. Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field The- ory, one way of connecting gravity dual models to gauge theories, is a correspon- dence between a ten-dimensional Type IIB superstring theory in AdS5 $\backslash$times S 5 and a N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. To describe systems that are experimentally ac- cessible, however, the formal correspondence is modified into a phenomenological duality between a five-dimensional gravity model and a strongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory. This duality is referred to as AdS/QCD. This work explores aspects of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The phrase 'soft wall' refers to the means of breaking the conformal symmetry and introducing a mass scale to the gauge side of the duality. We add higher-order terms to the soft-wall Lagrangian and calculate the effect on physical observables. Meson mass spectra gain a more complex structure, exhibiting a better match with the experimental values than previous models. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner rela- tion naturally emerges from the model. We calculate the form factor F\{$\backslash$pi\} and the coupling g\{$\backslash$rho\}\{$\backslash$pi\}\{$\backslash$pi\} as a non-trivial test on the limits of our soft-wall model. Introducing a black brane into the gravity dual metric allows us to derive thermodynamic quantities in the gauge theory. As expected at high temperatures, the entropy scales as the cube of the temperature, and the speed of sound reaches its conformal limit of one-third. Thermal condensates contribute leading-order terms, modifying the temperature, entropy, and free energy behavior. We find that the system undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter to a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at a critical temperature.},

Such theories, for a judicious choice of potential are very close to the physics of large-N YM theory both at zero and finite temperature. The zero temperature glueball spectra as well as their finite temperature thermodynamic functions compare well with lattice data. The model can be used to calculate transport coefficients, like bulk viscosity, the drag force and jet quenching parameters, relevant for the physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, both experimental and theoretical advances have brought the need for strong coupling techniques in the analysis of deconfined QCD matter and heavy ion collisions to the forefront. As a consequence, a fruitful interplay has developed between analyses of strongly-coupled non-abelian plasmas via the gauge/string duality (also referred to as the AdS/CFT correspondence) and the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions. We review some of the main insights gained from this interplay to date. To establish a common language, we start with an introduction to heavy ion phenomenology and finite-temperature QCD, and a corresponding introduction to important concepts and techniques in the gauge/string duality. These introductory sections are written for nonspecialists, with the goal of bringing readers ranging from beginning graduate students to experienced practitioners of either QCD or gauge/string duality to the point that they understand enough about both fields that they can then appreciate their interplay in all appropriate contexts. We then review the current state-of-the art in the application of the duality to the description of the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas, with emphases that include: its thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and transport properties; the way it both modifies the dynamics of, and is perturbed by, high-energy or heavy quarks passing through it; and the physics of quarkonium mesons within it. We seek throughout to stress the lessons that can be extracted from these computations for heavy ion physics as well as to discuss future directions and open problems for the field.},

With a right parameter range, we obtain no such massless vector meson. We also find that, contrary to the soft-wall model with quadratic dilaton profile, the model allows a non-vanishing quark condensate in the chiral limit.

abstract = {We summarize the dual gravity description for a thermal gauge theory,
reviewing the key features of our holographic model of large N QCD and
elaborating on some new results.The theory has matter in the fundamental
representation and the gauge coupling runs logarithmically with energy scale at
low energies. At the highest energies the theory becomes approximately scale
invariant, much like what we would expect for large N QCD although not with
asymptotic freedom. In this limit the theory has a gravity dual captured by an
almost classical supergravity description with a controlled quantum behavior,
such that by renormalizing the supergravity action, we can compute the stress
tensor of the dual gauge theory. From the stress tensor we obtain the shear
viscosity and the entropy of the medium at a temperature T, and the violation
of the bound for the viscosity to the entropy ratio is then investigated. By
considering dynamics of open strings in curved spacetime described by the
supergravity limit, we compute the drag and diffusion coefficients for a heavy
parton traversing the thermal medium. It is shown that both coefficients have a
logarithmic dependence on momentum, consistent with pQCD expectations. Finally,
we study the confinement/deconfinement mechanism for quarks by analyzing open
strings in the presence of the flavor seven branes. We find linear confinement
of quarks at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the quarkonium states
melt, a behavior consistent with the existence of a deconfined phase.},

abstract = {Ideas and techniques known in quantum electrodynamics have been applied to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In an approximation which corresponds to a generalization of the Hartree-Fock fields, one can write down an integral equation defining the self-energy of an electron in an electron gas with phonon and Coulomb interaction. The form of the equation implies the existence of a particular solution which does not follow from perturbation theory, and which leads to the energy gap equation and the quasi-particle picture analogous to Bogoliubov's.The gauge invariance, to the first order in the external electromagnetic field, can be maintained in the quasi-particle picture by taking into account a certain class of corrections to the chargecurrent operator due to the phonon and Coulomb interaction. In fact, generalized forms of the Ward identity are obtained between certain vertex parts and the self-energy. The Meissner effect calculation is thus rendered strictly gauge invariant, but essentially keeping the BCS result unaltered for transverse fields.It is shown also that the integral equation for vertex parts allows homogeneous solutions which describe collective excitations of quasi-particle pairs, and the nature and effects of such collective states are discussed.},

abstract = {The chiral symmetry of QCD shows up in the linear Weyl-Wigner mode at short Euclidean distances or at high temperatures. On the other hand, low-lying hadronic states exhibit the nonlinear Nambu-Goldstone mode. An interesting question was raised as to whether the linear realization of the chiral symmetry is asymptotically restored for highly excited states. We address it in a number of ways. On the phenomenological side we argue that to the extent the meson Regge trajectories are observed to be linear and equidistant, the Weyl-Wigner mode is not realized. This picture is supported by quasiclassical arguments implying that the quark spin interactions in high excitations are weak, the trajectories are linear, and there is no chiral symmetry restoration. Then we use the string/gauge duality. In the top-down Sakai-Sugimoto construction the nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry is built in. In the bottom-up AdS/QCD construction by Erlich et al. and Karch et al. the situation is more ambiguous. However, in this approach linearity and equidistance of the Regge trajectories can be naturally implemented, with the chiral symmetry in the Nambu-Goldstone mode. Asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration might be possible if a nonlinearity (convergence) of the Regge trajectories in an ” intermediate window” of n, J, beyond the explored domain, takes place. This would signal the failure of the quasiclassical picture.},

@article{ads-qcd-undelivered,
abstract = {We consider the particle spectrum and event shapes in large N gauge theories
in different regimes of the short-distance 't Hooft coupling, lambda. The
mesons in the small lambda limit should have a Regge spectrum in order to agree
with perturbation theory, while generically the large lambda theories with
gravity duals produce spectra reminiscent of KK modes. We argue that these
KK-like states are qualitatively different from QCD modes: they are deeply
bound states which are sensitive to short distance interactions rather than the
flux tube-like states expected in asymptotically free, confining gauge
theories. In addition, we also find that the characteristic event shapes for
the large lambda theories with gravity duals are close to spherical, very
different from QCD-like (small lambda, small N) and Nambu-Goto-like (small
lambda, large N) theories which have jets. This observation is in agreement
with the conjecture of Strassler on event shapes in large 't Hooft coupling
theories, which was recently proved by Hofman and Maldacena for the conformal
case. This conclusion does not change even when considering soft-wall
backgrounds in the gravity dual. The picture that emerges is the following:
theories with small and large lambda are qualitatively different, while
theories with small and large N are qualitatively similar. Thus it seems that
it is the relative smallness of the 't Hooft coupling in QCD that prevents a
reliable AdS/QCD correspondence from emerging, and that reproducing
characteristic QCD-like behavior will require genuine stringy dynamics to be
incorporated into any putative dual theory.},

abstract = {Gauge/Gravity dualities open the non-perturbative realms of strongly-coupled
gauge theories to analytic treatment. Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field The-
ory, one way of connecting gravity dual models to gauge theories, is a
correspon- dence between a ten-dimensional Type IIB superstring theory in AdS5
$\backslash$times S 5 and a N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. To describe systems that are
experimentally ac- cessible, however, the formal correspondence is modified
into a phenomenological duality between a five-dimensional gravity model and a
strongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory. This duality is referred to as AdS/QCD.
This work explores aspects of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The phrase 'soft
wall' refers to the means of breaking the conformal symmetry and introducing a
mass scale to the gauge side of the duality. We add higher-order terms to the
soft-wall Lagrangian and calculate the effect on physical observables. Meson
mass spectra gain a more complex structure, exhibiting a better match with the
experimental values than previous models. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner rela- tion
naturally emerges from the model. We calculate the form factor F\{$\pi$\} and the
coupling g\{$\rho$\}\{$\pi$\}\{$\pi$\} as a non-trivial test on the limits of our soft-wall
model. Introducing a black brane into the gravity dual metric allows us to
derive thermodynamic quantities in the gauge theory. As expected at high
temperatures, the entropy scales as the cube of the temperature, and the speed
of sound reaches its conformal limit of one-third. Thermal condensates
contribute leading-order terms, modifying the temperature, entropy, and free
energy behavior. We find that the system undergoes a phase transition from
hadronic matter to a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at a critical
temperature.},

@article{citeulike:5978745,
abstract = {The hydrodynamic (hydro) model applied to heavy ion data from the
relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) in the form of single-particle spectra
and correlations seems to indicate that a dense QCD medium nearly opaque to
partons, a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), is formed in
more-central Au-Au collisions, and that the sQGP may have a very small
viscosity ("perfect liquid"). Measurements of radial and elliptic flows, with
possible coalescence of "constituent quarks" to form hadrons, seem to support
the conclusion. However, other measurements provide contradictory evidence.
Unbiased angular correlations indicate that a large number of back-to-back jets
from initial-state scattered partons with energies as low as 3 GeV survive as
"minijet" hadron correlations even in central Au-Au collisions, suggesting near
transparency. Two-component analysis of single-particle hadron spectra reveals
a corresponding spectrum hard component (parton fragment distribution described
by pQCD) which can masquerade as "radial flow" in some spectrum analysis.
Reinterpretation of "elliptic flow" as a QCD scattering process resulting in
fragmentation is also possible. In this paper I review analysis methods and
results in the context of two paradigms: the conventional
hydrodynamics/hard-probes paradigm and an alternative quadrupole/minijets
paradigm. Based on re-interpretation of fiducial data I argue that
hydrodynamics may not be relevant to RHIC collisions. Collision evolution may
be dominated by parton scattering and fragmentation, albeit the fragmentation
process is strongly modified in more-central A-A collisions.},

abstract = {We extend the description of flavour that exists in the Randall-Sundrum (RS)
model to the soft wall (SW) model in which the IR brane is removed and the
Higgs is free to propagate in the bulk. It is demonstrated that, like the RS
model, one can generate the hierarchy of fermion masses by localising the
fermions at different locations throughout the space. However, there are two
significant differences. Firstly the possible fermion masses scale down, from
the electroweak scale, less steeply than in the RS model and secondly there now
exists a minimum fermion mass for fermions sitting towards the UV brane. With a
quadratic Higgs VEV, this minimum mass is about fifteen orders of magnitude
lower than the electroweak scale. We derive the gauge propagator and despite
the KK masses scaling as \$m\_n\^{}2\~{}n\$, it is demonstrated that the
coefficients of four fermion operators are not divergent at tree level. FCNC's
amongst kaons and leptons are considered and compared to calculations in the RS
model with equivalent levels of tuning. It is found that since the gauge
fermion couplings are slightly more universal and the SM fermions typically sit
slightly further towards the UV brane, the contributions to observables such as
\$\epsilon\_K\$ and \$\Delta m\_K\$, from the exchange of KK gauge fields, are
significantly reduced.},

abstract = {This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, V ud \& V us , V cb \& V ub , fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review . All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: pdg.lbl.gov .},

@article{katz-tensor-mesons,
abstract = {We explore tensor mesons in AdS/QCD focusing on f2 (1270), the lightestspin-two resonance in QCD. We find that the f2 mass and the partial width forf2 -> gamma gamma are in very good agreement with data. In fact, thedimensionless ratio of these two quantities comes out within the currentexperimental bound. The result for this ratio depends only on Nc and Nf, andthe quark and glueball content of the operator responsible for the f2; moreimportantly, it does not depend on chiral symmetry breaking and so is bothindependent of much of the arbitrariness of AdS/QCD and completely out of reachof chiral perturbation theory. For comparison, we also explore f2 -> pi pi,which because of its sensitivity to the UV corrections has much moreuncertainty. We also calculate the masses of the higher spin resonances on theRegge trajectory of the f2, and find they compare favorably with experiment.},

abstract = {We study light scalar mesons in the AdS/QCD soft-wall model with a background dilaton field. The masses and decay constants are compatible with experiment and QCD determinations if \$a\_0(980)\$ and \$f\_0(980)\$ are identified as the lightest scalar mesons; moreover, the states are organized in linear Regge trajectories with the same slope of vector mesons. Comparing the two-point correlation function of scalar operators in AdS and QCD, information about the condensates can be derived. Strong couplings of scalar states to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons turn out to be small, at odds with experiment and QCD estimates: this discrepancy is related to the description of chiral symmetry breaking in this model.},

abstract = {Bottom-up holographic models of QCD, inspired by the anti-de Sitter space/conformal field theory correspondence, have shown a remarkable degree of phenomenological success. However, they rely on a number of bold assumptions. We investigate the reliability of one of the key assumptions, which involves matching the parameters of these models to QCD at high 4D momentum q2 and renormalization scale $\mu$2. We show that this leads to phenomenological and theoretical inconsistencies for scale-dependent quantities such as 〈q̅ q〉.},

@article{Batell2008,
abstract = {We present a solution of the five-dimensional gravity-dilaton-tachyon equations of motion with a pure AdS5 metric and a quadratic dilaton and linear tachyon in conformal coordinates. This leads to an infrared soft-wall model where the dilaton profile gives rise to linear Regge trajectories for the four-dimensional mass spectrum of the dual gauge theory. Even though our approach is phenomenological the scalar fields resemble the dilaton and the closed string tachyon of a noncritical string theory. Interestingly, the linear tachyon has the correct profile to imply that chiral symmetry is not restored for highly excited states. Our solution thus provides a dynamical bottom-up model of linear confinement in holographic QCD.},
