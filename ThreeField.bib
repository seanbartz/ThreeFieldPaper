abstract = {We present a solution of the five-dimensional gravity-dilaton-tachyon equations of motion with a pure AdS5 metric and a quadratic dilaton and linear tachyon in conformal coordinates. This leads to an infrared soft-wall model where the dilaton profile gives rise to linear Regge trajectories for the four-dimensional mass spectrum of the dual gauge theory. Even though our approach is phenomenological the scalar fields resemble the dilaton and the closed string tachyon of a noncritical string theory. Interestingly, the linear tachyon has the correct profile to imply that chiral symmetry is not restored for highly excited states. Our solution thus provides a dynamical bottom-up model of linear confinement in holographic QCD.},

abstract = {Recently a holographic model of hadrons motivated by AdS/CFT has been proposed to fit the low energy data of mesons. We point out that the infrared physics can be developed in a more systematic manner by exploiting backreaction of the nonperturbative condensates. We show that these condensates can naturally provide the IR cutoff corresponding to confinement, thus removing some of the ambiguities from the original formulation of the model. We also show how asymptotic freedom can be incorporated into the theory, and the substantial effect it has on the glueball spectrum and gluon condensate of the theory. A simple reinterpretation of the holographic scale results in a non-perturbative running for alpha\_s which remains finite for all energies. We also find the leading effects of adding the higher condensate into the theory. The difficulties for such models to reproduce the proper Regge physics lead us to speculate about extensions of our model incorporating tachyon condensation.},

The thermal spectral function is computed, which shows that the position of peak moves towards a smaller value and the width of peak also broadens to a larger value as the temperature increases. The critical temperature at which the peaks are completely dissolved has been found to be around \$T\_\{c\}\backslash simeq 160\backslash sim 200\backslash MeV\$.

Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level \$n\$ acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as \$2\backslash left (n g\_\{YM\} \backslash sqrt \{2 N\} )\^{}\{1/2\}\$ for large `t Hooft coupling.

abstract = {In this work, we offer a dynamical soft-wall model to describe the gluodynamics and chiral dynamics in one systematical framework. We firstly construct a quenched dynamical holographic QCD (hQCD) model in the graviton-dilaton framework for the pure gluon system, then develop a dynamical hQCD model for the two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework by adding light flavors on the gluodynamical background. For two forms of dilaton background field \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\$ and \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\backslash tanh(\backslash mu\_\{G\^{}2\}\^{}4z\^{}2/\backslash mu\_G\^{}2)\$, the quadratic correction to dilaton background field at infrared encodes important non-perturbative gluodynamics and naturally induces a deformed warp factor of the metric. By self-consistently solving the deformed metric induced by the dilaton background field, we find that the scalar glueball spectra in the quenched dynamical model is in very well agreement with lattice data. For two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework, the deformed metric is self-consistently solved by considering both the chiral condensate and nonperturbative gluodynamics in the vacuum, which are responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement, respectively. It is found that the mixing between the chiral condensate and gluon condensate is important to produce the correct light flavor meson spectra. The pion form factor and the vector couplings are also investigated in the dynamical hQCD model. Besides, we give the criteria for the existence of linear quark potential from the metric structure, and show a negative quadratic dilaton background field is not favored in the graviton-dilaton framework.},

@misc{Paula2012,
abstract = {We discuss applications of gauge/gravity duality to describe the spectrum of light hadrons. We compare two particular 5-dimensional approaches: a model with an infrared deformed Anti-de Sitter metric and another one based on a dynamical AdS/QCD framework with back-reacted geometry in a dilaton/gravity background. The models break softly the scale invariance in the infrared region and allow mass gap for the field excitations in the gravity description, while keeping the conformal property of the metric close to the four-dimensional boundary. The models provide linear Regge trajectories for light mesons, associated with specially designed infrared gravity properties. We also review the results for the decay widths of the f0's into two pions, as overlap integrals between mesonic string amplitudes, which are in qualitative agreement with data.},

abstract = {We extend an infrared-deformed soft-wall anti de-Sitter/QCD model at zero temperature to a model at finite temperature and perform hydrodynamics. To have the infalling boundary condition to make the hydrodynamic analysis possible, we treat the infrared energy scale factor in our metric as a temperature-depending parameter. Then, by carrying out the hydrodynamic analysis, we compute the transport coefficients, the diffusion constant, and the shear viscosity, through the linear response theory.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {In this paper a model incorporating chiral symmetry breaking and dynamical soft-wall AdS/QCD is established. The AdS/QCD background is introduced dynamically as suggested by Wayne de Paula etc al and chiral symmetry breaking is discussed by using a bulk scalar field including a cubic term. The mass spectrum of scalar, vector and axial vector mesons are obtained and a comparison with experimental data is presented.},

@article{Witten1998,
abstract = {Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large \$N\$ limits of certain conformal field theories in \$d\$ dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of \$d+1\$-dimensional \$AdS\$ space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5\backslash times \{\backslash bf S\}\^{}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \$\backslash N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \$\backslash N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},
